       The raster project was difficult because I have no prior design experience. <br>I was unsure about my color pallete, placement, balance, etc. I was also unsure about the photo I used as focus. <br>As far as technicalities, I found Photoshop relatively simple to use. So once I got started, I ran with a funky, 70s vibe. </p>
