    <h1> San Francisco: the best and the worst.</h1>
    <h2> The Mission </h2>

    <p>
        I <em>love</em> the Mission because of all the great food. The neighborhood is a multicultural web of culinary concoctions. You can also find free Yoga (to the People), Dolores Park, and a plethora of street art. </p>
    <h2> The Financial District </h2>
    <p> I guess the Fi-Di isn't so bad for late nights and bar hopping, but there are so many people there throughout the day that my claustrophobia starts acting up- and I am not claustrophobic. Tourists who can't stay on the right side of the escalators, homeless people wandering about with scary puppy dog eyes, and entirely self-absorbed business men in suits are <strong>not</strong> my favorite. </p>
